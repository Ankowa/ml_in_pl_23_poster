\block{\textsc{Problem: lack of nonmembers set}}{
    \textit{We cannot run MIA evaluation without nonmembers}. A few approaches has been proposed:
    \begin{enumerate}{
        \item Fine-tune Stable Diffusion on a new dataset\cite{duan2023diffusion}. \textbf{Pitfall}: too trivial problem due to overfitting.
        \item Train a new model on a new dataset. \textbf{Problem}: too expensive.
        \item Create a dataset with similar properties to the original one. \textbf{Challenge}: distribution mismatch.
    }\end{enumerate}
