\block{\textsc{Problem: lack of nonmembers set}}{
    We cannot run MIA evaluation without nonmembers. A few approaches has been proposed:
    \begin{enumerate}{
        \item Fine-tune Stable Diffusion on a new dataset. \textbf{Pitfall}: too trivial problem due to overfitting.    % TODO: add citation
        \item Train a new model on a new dataset. \textbf{Pitfall}: too expensive.  % TODO: add citation
        \item Create a dataset with similar properties to the original one. \textbf{Challenge}: distribution mismatch.
    }\end{enumerate}
