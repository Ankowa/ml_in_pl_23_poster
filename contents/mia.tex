\block{\textsc{Membership Inference Attacks}}{
    Stable Diffusion has been allegedly trained on copyrighted data. We want to find a way to be able to realistically assess if such claims are legitimate. Extracting this information from a model is known as \textit{membership inference attack}. In this work
    \begin{itemize}{
        \item We identify the pitfalls of existing solutions.
        \item We provide a new dataset along with construction methodology.
        \item We propose a fair and rigorous evaluation protocol on the SOTA Stable Diffusion model.
        \item We thoroughly evaluate a set of membership inference attacks using our dataset and methodology.
    }\end{itemize}
