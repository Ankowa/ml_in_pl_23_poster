\block{\textsc{Introduction}}{
    Stable Diffusion has been allegedly trained on \textit{copyrighted} data. We want to find a way to be able to realistically assess if such claims are legitimate. Extracting this information from a model is known as \textit{membership inference attack} (MIA). In this work
    \begin{itemize}{
        \item We identify the \textbf{pitfalls} of existing solutions.
        \item We provide a new \textbf{dataset} along with construction methodology.
        \item We propose a \textbf{fair} and \textbf{rigorous} evaluation protocol on the \textbf{SOTA Stable Diffusion model}.
        \item We thoroughly evaluate a set of \textit{MIAs} using our dataset and methodology.
    }\end{itemize}
